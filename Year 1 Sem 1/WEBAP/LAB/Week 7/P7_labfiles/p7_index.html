				<h2>Mountain Climbing</h2>
				<p>Taiwan is a mountainous country, with terrain ranging from beautiful forested hill
				   to soaring peaks.</p>
				<p>Prime trekking areas include Alishan, where there is an extensive network of hiking
				   trails offer everything from day hikes to serious ascent trekking. Highly recommended
				   is the 10 hour circult to Fengshan, or the easy dawn hike to the summit of Chuahan 
				   to watch the sunrise.</p>

				<h2>Shopping at Taipei 101</h2>
				<p>At 508 meters (1,671 feet), it is the tallest building in the world. It is a classy 
				   shopping center (Taipei 101 Mall) packed with expensive designer-label clothing stores 
				   and luxury restaurants. On the fourth floor is a magnificent bookstore (Page One) and 
				   the chance to rest tired feet in one of several coffeeshops. Ride the escalator down to 
				   the B1 level for Taipet's biggest and finest food court, and to one of the best-stocked
				   supermarkets in Taiwan (Jason's Marketplace), full of international food products that are 
				   hard to find elsewhere on the island.</p>
