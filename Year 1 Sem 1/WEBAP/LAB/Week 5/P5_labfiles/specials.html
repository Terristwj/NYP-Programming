<h1 id="top">FEATURED DINNERS</h1>  

<p>Pasta Divine has an extensive carry out menu including many of our sandwiches and salads. In 
addition, each month we feature a few of our most popular dinner dishes for carry out. We try to make 
carry out very convenient for our customers. You do not even have to get out of your car and come 
into the restaurant; we deliver the pasta to your car door! Just phone us when you are close to the 
restaurant, and we will bring your steaming hot pasta dishes out to you.</p>

<h3>Fettuccine Alfredo</h3>
<p>

</p>
<p>
Our fettuccine alfredo dish is a traditional Italian recipe your family will love! The secret is 
in our rich fettuccine alfredo sauce. The sauce is what makes this dish so popular. The alfredo sauce 
recipe comes from the Lazio area of Italy. The cream cheese that we use in our sauce is the best that 
is made, and that adds to the creamy richness. Because this fettuccine dish is so simple, it's important 
to use good-quality ingredients.

<p>
Lasagna was Grandpa Salvatore's favorite dish. His Mother used to make lasagna for the whole 
neighborhood back in the Toscana area of Italy where she grew up. Our lasagna is brimming with a 
spiced beef and pork filling mixed with our secret marinara sauce.
For lighter fare, you can choose our vegetable lasagna. This healthy meal is filled with a 
mix of fresh vegetables together with the same marinara sauce.</p>

<h3>Ravioli</h3>
<p>

</p>
<p>
Ravioli is traditionally two pieces of thin pasta dough filled with meat, cheese, or vegetables.
Our ravioli comes from the Umbria area of Italy where they mix the filling with a rich pesto sauce
combined with warm yogurt. This makes the ravioli creamy as well as mouthwatering. 
You can order our ravioli as prepared or purchase frozen ravioli to make later. Either way, this
dish is an award-winner.</p>
