				<h2>Mountain Climbing</h2>
				<p>Taiwan is a mountainous country, with terrain ranging from beautiful forested 
				hill to soaring peaks.</p>
				<p>Prime trekking areas include Alishan, where there is an extensive network 
				of hiking trails offer everything from day hikes to serious ascent 
				trekking. Highly recommended is the 10 hour circuit to Fengshan, or 
				the easy dawn hike to the summit of Chushan to watch the sunrise.</p>

				<h2>Shopping at Taipei 101 </h2>
				<p>At 508 meters (1,671 feet), it is the tallest building in the world.
				It is a classy shopping center (Taipei 101 Mall) packed with expensive 
				designer-label clothing stores and luxury restaurants.
				On the fourth floor is a magnificent bookstore (Page One) and
				the chance to rest tired feet in one of several coffeeshops. 
				Ride the escalator down to the B1 level for Taipei's biggest 
				and finest food court, and to one of the best-stocked supermarkets
				in Taiwan (Jason's Marketplace), full of international food products
				that are hard to find elsewhere on the island.</p>
