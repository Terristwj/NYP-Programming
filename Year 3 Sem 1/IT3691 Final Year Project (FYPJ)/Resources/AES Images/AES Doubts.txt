AES Doubts

1. What project do I click?
- The title is "Guide Tour Taskforce" but my current project is not actually that.


2. What that is to be submitted exactly?
- I have a list of reports
    - Usage Guides
    - How to recreate
    - Trouble-shooting
- Most are not related to each other, but parts of the project like network troubleshooting


3. Can I just upload them as word documents?
- Or do I have to rewrite everything into proper sections?


4. From existing work, I saw infographs, diagrams, use-cases
- Must I also provide those since the nature of the work is "Exploration".


5. Is there a strict rule on how to organise what is uploaded?
- I saw sections like:
   - Project Documentation
   - Project Management
   - Document Share
   - Project Discussions
- Are there any sections that are not applicable for me as I am a solo student?


Create a specific documentation for Google BigQuery and AWS RDS
Look through all documentations again and export into Word document

Collect all files and collate them into a zip file orderly
 - Eg. Reports, Slides, Demo Codes, Resources (Anything additional)

Remove all connection String and GOOGLE CREDENTIALS
