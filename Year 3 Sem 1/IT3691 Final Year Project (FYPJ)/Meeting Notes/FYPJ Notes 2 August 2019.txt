RoomBooking data insights
- Early Leave
- Check sleeping?
- Using sensor data (raw) to create insights data then help adjust the system

raw > info > trend 
light + motion > empty room early > Avg(empty room early)

count(light:on + motion:off) > empty room frequency > Avg(empty room frequency) > Conclusion: Room booking should consider room left empty too many times is considered as empty

Reverse engineering the idea.
Think about the outcome then what data I need.
